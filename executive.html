                <p class="text"> Founder </p>
                <p class="bio"> As of June 2020, Jonathan has graduated from Stamford American International School, Singapore, and will be attending UC Berkeley in the fall. He started the International Youth Science Journal in August 2018 as a way to share his enthusiasm for science with the online youth community. Very passionate about Biochemistry and really anything STEM-related, he founded and led his high school’s Science Society, and conducted research with NanoBio Lab under A*STAR over the summer. Being a keen Maker, he’s DIYed everything from a quadcopter to a 1:1 replica of a Portal Gun from Portal. Some of Jonathan’s other hobbies are playing board games, watching movies, and playing percussion. He hopes that IYSJ will live on after his time here and welcomes any suggestions, questions, concerns, comments, or criticisms to be sent to <a href = "mailto: iysjournal@gmail.com">iysjournal@gmail.com</a> or <a href = "mailto: that.jonathan.liu@berkeley.edu">that.jonathan.liu@berkeley.edu</a>

            <p class="bio"> Faye is a junior at North London Collegiate School in the UK. Faye’s love of physics started very young, competing in maths challenges well above her age category throughout elementary school. After years of expanding her knowledge of the subject, Faye was able to gain an understanding of the fundamental theories of the universe; these being quantum mechanics, quantum field theory and general relativity. She is fascinated by the unification of these theories and quantum gravity (from which emerges ‘the theory of everything’). Faye is always looking to inspire a love of physics within younger generations whether that be through writing articles, giving talks and hosting competitions. Faye aims to study theoretical physics in the future, and possibly pursue this to a PhD level. Outside the classroom, Faye enjoys teaching flamenco to kids and performing at restaurants, weddings and theatres.
